# Project Raspberry
Raspberry app will be a mobile friendly(if not centric) web application that can scrape any recipe off "any" website and add that to your own personal cookbook. Meal planning and shopping continues to be a drag and this app will allow you to "easily" meal plan for a week or more at a time. Once everything is planned out, a Shopping mode will give you a shopping list of the ingredients needed for the week. Now I'm no fan of cooking and having to navigate through small text to figure out what to do next, so in Cooking mode, step by step instructions will be shown one at a time in cards in order to facilitate the navigation.  

Now it sounds like something that has been done before, and I'm frankly afraid to look up a better already made solution but the whole point is to create a useful tool for myself and possibly some friends. Along the way, I will try to use as little 3rd party libraries, and no frameworks if possible (except maybe in authentication).
